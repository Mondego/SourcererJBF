This package contains Java source code, under projects, and its corresponding bytecode, 
under builds. There are 9145 projects, so not quite 10k, but close. 
If you just need the bytecode, there is no need for further action. 
If, however, you want to regenerate the bytecodes you need to run the script compile.py. 
Read on.

REQUIREMENTS
==============
python packages: subprocess32, chardet
pip install subprocess32
pip install chardet

java version: jdk8+
ant version: any that uses javac from jdk8+

COMMAND TO BUILD PROJECTS
==============
./compile.py -r projects [-t <number of worker threads you want>]

-t defaults to 10. Full help is given at the bottom.

IMPORTANT FILES & FOLDERS
==============
projects/ -> All the projects that can be build. There are at most 1000 projects in each folder in projects/
builds/ -> All the generated bytecodes and complete information about the latest build

project_details.json -> Bookkeeping details for the projects that instruct the compilation script on how to build them successfully. This file has been generated from the previous successful run.

jars/ -> The repository of jars needed for these projects.
    /ext -> our own copy of java extention jars, and any other special jars

sourcererjbf/ -> The python package with scripts for building the projects.

xml-templates/ -> The templates of the build.xml, and ivy.xml files used when building the projects.

fqn-to-jars.json -> The global mapping of FQNs to jars, from our huge repository

compile.py -> The main driver script for building projects.


GENERATED FILES & FOLDERS
==============
builds/ -> The output of the build process. Each project build data is placed here in a heirarchy that is similar to that of projects/
TBUILD/ -> Temporary build folders for all threads. (ignore)
Uncompress/ -> Temporary folder used to unzip the project files from their zip archives. (ignore)
hs_*.log -> Log files generated by worker threads in case of failures.(ignore)

NOTE: please delete all these generated files & folders before each new run of compile.py.

COMPILE.PY HELP
==============
usage: compile.py [-h] [-r ROOT] [-b] [-f FILE] [-d OUTFOLDER] [-o OUTPUT]
                  [-j JARS] [-ftj FQN_TO_JAR] [-t THREADS]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -r ROOT, --root ROOT  The directory under which all the java projects to be
                        compiled exist.
  -b, --rebuild_from_scratch
                        Rebuild the projects from scratch. Dependency
                        rematching implies that all projects might not
                        recompile successfully.
  -f FILE, --file FILE  The file with project paths to be build. Paths in file
                        are considered relative to the root directory.
  -d OUTFOLDER, --outfolder OUTFOLDER
                        The directory under which all the output build
                        directories will be put.
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        An output file that will contain all the output
                        information consolidated.
  -j JARS, --jars JARS  The root of the java repository
  -ftj FQN_TO_JAR, --fqn_to_jar FQN_TO_JAR
                        The file that represents the mapping of fqn to jar in
                        repository.
  -t THREADS, --threads THREADS
                        The number of base threads to be run.
